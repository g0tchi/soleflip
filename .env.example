# Environment variables for SoleFlipper API
#
# For Docker Compose, this file should be copied to .env and the values filled in.
# For local development without Docker, these can be set in your shell's environment.

# --- Database ---
# The URL for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
# For Docker Compose, use the service name 'metabase-db' as the host, as defined in docker-compose.yml.
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://metabaseuser:metabasepass@metabase-db:5432/metabase


# --- Security ---
# A secret key used for encrypting sensitive fields in the database (e.g., API credentials).
# This MUST be a 32-byte, URL-safe base64-encoded string.
#
# Generate a new key with the following Python command:
# python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
#
# IMPORTANT: Keep this key secret and safe. If you lose it, you will not be able
# to decrypt the data stored in the database.

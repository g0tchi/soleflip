## [2.0.1] - 2025-08-15 - Maintenance Release

### 🧹 Housekeeping & Refactoring

#### Changed
- **Simplified `README.md`**: Restructured the main README for clarity and conciseness. Redundant sections like the detailed changelog were removed in favor of a direct link to this file.
- **Improved `.gitignore`**: Added common Python build artifacts (`dist/`, `build/`, `*.egg-info/`) to the `.gitignore` file to keep the repository clean.

#### Removed
- **Redundant Documentation**: Deleted `VERSION.md` and `VERSION_NOTES.md` to establish `CHANGELOG.md` as the single source of truth for version history.
- **Obsolete Scripts**: Removed three outdated and special-purpose backup scripts from `scripts/database/`. The robust `create_backup.py` is now the sole backup script.
- **Obsolete SQL Queries**: Deleted the old `brand_dashboard_queries.sql` file from `metabase/queries/` to prevent confusion.
- **Outdated Document Folders**: Removed the `docs/guides/archive/` and `docs/completed_tasks/` directories as they contained outdated development artifacts.

#### Fixed
- **Consolidated Metabase Assets**: Moved the `metabase_dashboards.json` file from `docs/completed_tasks/` to `metabase/` to logically group all Metabase-related assets.
